# AI-Assisted Adaptive Clinical Trial for Early Treatment Failure in Type 2 Diabetes

##  Project Overview

This project presents an **AI-assisted adaptive clinical trial framework** designed to identify and respond to **early treatment failure in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**. The study integrates **machine learning–based risk prediction**, **adaptive trial design**, and **real-world data simulation** to improve personalized treatment decision-making and trial efficiency.

Traditional clinical trials in diabetes often rely on static treatment allocation and population-level outcomes. This project demonstrates how **artificial intelligence can be embedded within an adaptive trial framework** to dynamically stratify risk, guide treatment adjustments, and compare outcomes between conventional and AI-adaptive trial arms.

##  Objectives

The project is guided by the following objectives:

1. To develop an AI-driven adaptive clinical trial framework that integrates wearable biomarker data (e.g., continuous glucose, heart rate variability, physical activity) to predict early treatment failure in Type 2 diabetes patients.
2. To evaluate the feasibility and data quality of a decentralized clinical trial model using mobile health technologies in Sub-Saharan African healthcare settings.
3. To assess whether AI-assisted real-time treatment adjustments reduce time to therapeutic optimization compared to conventional fixed-protocol clinical trials.

##  Methodology

* **Study Design:** Simulated adaptive clinical trial
* **Data:** Synthetic dataset representing 1,000 participants with Type 2 Diabetes
* **Features:** Clinical variables, behavioral indicators, and simulated wearable-derived metrics
* **Modeling Approach:** Machine learning classification for early treatment failure prediction
* **Trial Arms:**

  * Conventional control arm (static treatment)
  * AI-adaptive arm (risk-based treatment adjustment)

The adaptive framework uses model-predicted risk levels to guide treatment escalation or optimization during the simulated trial.
